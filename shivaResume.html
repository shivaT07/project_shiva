       <h1>Certification</h1>
       <hr>
       <p><b>Ethical Hacking | Zephyr Technologies</b></p>
       <ul>
        <li>Completed a Certified Course on Ethical Hacking for duration of two months. Kali Linux is one of the tools I have used during the course. I've gained fundamental skills in ethical hacking that are vital for assessing and securing systems. I've learned the art of penetration testing, adept at uncovering vulnerabilities that could compromise security. Additionally, I'm proficient in conducting vulnerability assessments, identifying weaknesses, and prioritizing their mitigation. Understanding exploitation techniques has equipped me with the knowledge to exploit vulnerabilities responsibly, ensuring systems are fortified against unauthorized access. </li>
       </ul>
       <p><b>Python | Zephyr Technologies</b></p>
       <ul>
        <li>This course was on one month duration. Starting with the basics, I had become familiar with Python syntax and how to structure code effectively. I've learned about variables and data types, enabling me to store and manipulate different kinds of information. Understanding control structures like if statements and loops has allowed me to control the flow of my programs. I've explored data structures such as lists and dictionaries, learning how to organize and manage collections of data efficiently. File handling techniques have equipped me to read from and write to files on my computer. I've also been introduced to modules and packages. With an understanding of error handling, I'm better equipped to deal with mistakes and unexpected situations in my code. During the application of this course, I've worked on basic algorithms and completed simple projects, solidifying my understanding of Python fundamentals. </li>
