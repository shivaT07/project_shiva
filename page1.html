    <h1>Solar System</h1>
    <img src="/solar system.jpg" width="1200px">
    <p>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.[9] It was formed 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc. The Sun is an ordinary main sequence star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core, releasing this energy from its outer photosphere.

        The largest objects that orbit the Sun are the eight planets. In order from the Sun, they are four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn); and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). All terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. Inversely, all giant planets do not have a definite surface, as they are mainly composed of gases and liquids. Over 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and nearly 90% of the remaining mass is in Jupiter and Saturn.</p>

<h2 id="one">Mercury</h2>
<p>The smallest and fastest planet, Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and whips around it every 88 Earth days. It is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun, with extreme temperature variations between its scorching days and freezing nights. It lacks a substantial atmosphere, making it susceptible to solar winds and impacts from space debris.</p>

<h2 id="two">Venus</h2>
<p> Venus is often called Earth's twin due to its similar size and composition, but it has a toxic atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid clouds, creating a runaway greenhouse effect. Its surface is hot enough to melt lead, and it experiences a super-rotating atmosphere.</p>

<h2 id="three">Earth</h2>
<p> Earth is the only known planet with a diverse range of life forms, thanks to its moderate climate, abundant water, and protective atmosphere. It's the third planet from the Sun and the densest in the solar system, with vast oceans, continents, and a variety of ecosystems.</p>
<img src="/earth.jpg">
<h2 id="four">Mars</h2>
<p> Mars, often referred to as the Red Planet, has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide. It features evidence of ancient riverbeds and lake basins, suggesting the presence of liquid water in the past. Mars has polar ice caps, including frozen water and carbon dioxide.</p>

<h2 id="five">Jupiter</h2>
<p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, known for its distinctive bands of clouds and the Great Red Spot, a giant storm larger than Earth. It has a strong magnetic field and numerous moons, including the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.</p>

<h2 id="six">Saturn</h2>
<p>Saturn is famous for its stunning ring system, composed mostly of ice particles and rocky debris. It's the second-largest planet and has a similar composition to Jupiter, with swirling cloud bands and powerful storms. Saturn has numerous moons, including Titan, the second-largest moon in the solar system.</p>

<h2 id="seven">Uranus</h2>
<p>Uranus is an ice giant with a tilted rotational axis, causing it to appear to roll on its side as it orbits the Sun. It has a pale blue color due to methane in its atmosphere and a set of faint rings. Uranus has a diverse collection of moons, with some displaying unusual features like Miranda's fractured surface.</p>

<h2 id="eight">Neptune</h2>
<p> Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun and is characterized by its vivid blue coloration, caused by traces of methane in its atmosphere. It experiences extreme winds, with the fastest recorded in the solar system. Neptune has a series of faint rings and a collection of moons, including Triton, which orbits in a retrograde direction.</p>
